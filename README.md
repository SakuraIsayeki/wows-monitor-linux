## About wows-monitor

Version: **1.1.2**

This app was created with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).  
It mainly functions as a user interface for data provided by a centralized API written in [.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core).  

This app uses publicly available data from the Waraming API as part of the WG DPP program. By using this app you agree to:

*   fetching data from API on your behalf
*   processing of fetched data
*   display of fetched data in this app

It only accesses publicly available information (e.g. number of battles, statistics). We do not collect private data (e.g. email address, number of credits).

The color values for the Personal Rating and other stats are provided by [wows-numbers.com](https://wows-numbers.com)
